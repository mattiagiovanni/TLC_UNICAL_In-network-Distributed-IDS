# In-network-Distributed-IDS

This is the repository that contains the P4 code of the implemented In-Network Distributed and Ubiquitous Intrusion Detection System by leveraging the All Pairs Shortest Path Coloring Problem to deploy decomposed ML models within programmable networking devices in an intelligent way by taking into account both the shortest path nature of the network and the constraint of forcing networking flows to traverse the decomposed partitions of the model in order to reconstruct the output of the complex model to which they belong. 

The code will be uploaded after the relevant article will be accepted.
